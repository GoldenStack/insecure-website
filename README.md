# secure website

security is really too easy nowadays.

ever since Let's Encrypt, sites on the web are pretty much secure by default, because everyone has HTTPS.

i mean, i only found one billion dollar company last June with a few million exposed records on a public site!

this is beside the point though. security is clearly too easy. but what if it wasn't?

[server name indication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Name_Indication) is a method of making some things on the web easier. i assume. because i really do not know what it's used for except for the fact that it doesn't encrypt the subdomain you're accessing.

of course, the obvious next step is to communicate private information within this unencrypted field, just like the old days! 

once i actually finish this stupid website, you can login to your account by sending a request containing your credentials in the subdomain, such as:

`login-username-goldenstack-password-dosbox074.secure-website.goldenstack.net`

this has the side effect of having a maximum username and password length. but it's fine because it's already an incredible secure website.

please contact me if you would like to invest in my application

### !! details of the actual website will come soon !!

and when i say "soon" i mean right now.

it's just going to be a stupid little app where each user's "profile" shows their username and a little grid of checkboxes.

yep. this is all the customization that exists. i just wanted to make something nice and simple as a proof of concept for my revolutionary application.

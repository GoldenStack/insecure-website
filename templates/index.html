        <p>security is really too easy nowadays.</p>

        <p>ever since <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let's Encrypt</a>, sites on the web are pretty much secure by default, because everyone has HTTPS.</p>
        
        <p>i mean, i only found one billion dollar company last June with a few million exposed records on a public site!</p>
        
        <p>this is beside the point though. security is clearly too easy. but what if it wasn't?</p>
        
        <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Name_Indication">server name indication</a> is a method of making some things on the web easier. i assume. because i really do not know what it's used for except for the fact that it doesn't encrypt the subdomain you're accessing.</p>
        
        <p>of course, the obvious next step is to communicate private information within this unencrypted field, just like the old days!</p>
        
        <p>in this stupid website, you can login to your account by sending a request containing your credentials in the subdomain, such as:</p>
        
        <p><u>login-username-goldenstack-password-dosbox074{{ crate::HOSTNAME }}</u></p>
        
        <p>this has the side effect of having a maximum username and password length. but it's fine because it's already an incredible secure website.</p>

        <p>this site is a simple page where each user has a 5x5 grid of checkboxes that they can modify.</p>
        
        <p>yeah, there's not much to it. but the point of this website is to be a monstrosity, not a streamlined site</p>

        <p>i also made a website for it with my clearly incredible web design skills, in case you don't want to use raw requests.</p>
        
        <p>please contact me if you would like to invest in my application</p>

        <p>or if you would like to be verified :)</p>

        <h4>> ip grabber resistant!</h4>
        <p></p>
        
        <p>
            think this is an IP grabber? you can use this website entirely from common chat apps like Discord.
        </p>
        <p>
            sending the URL in chat constitutes a valid request, and can be used to interact with this app.

            relevant data will be returned and embedded in the message.

        <h4>> isn't this encrypted either way?</h4>
        <p></p>
        
        <p>
            i lied. i actually do know what server name indication is. i just thought it would be funny to say i don't.
        </p>
        <p>
            either way, i'm aware of DoH, and i'm happy to say that subdomains are still not encrypted under <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/firefox-dns-over-https">DNS over HTTPS</a>!
        </p>
        <p>
            this means this website is still gloriously insecure.
        </p>
        <p>
            unfortunately, <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/understand-encrypted-client-hello">Encrypted Client Hello</a> does actually encrypt this field. so please disable it in order to be able to fully experience this web site!
        </p>

        <br>

        <h4>> CORS-free!</h4>
        <p>
            ok, i lied again. there actually is CORS for the stylesheet and font:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="{{ crate::PREFIX }}assets-font{{ crate::HOSTNAME }}">{{ crate::PREFIX }}assets-font{{ crate::HOSTNAME }}</a></li>
            <li><a href="{{ crate::PREFIX }}assets-css{{ crate::HOSTNAME }}">{{ crate::PREFIX }}assets-css{{ crate::HOSTNAME }}</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            but other than that, no CORS is needed! browsers send HEAD requests to confirm CORS, but this website doesn't care about which type of request is sent ! so it works either way.
        </p>
        <p>
            also, most logic is handled via redirects anyway, so that isn't an issue either.
        </p>
